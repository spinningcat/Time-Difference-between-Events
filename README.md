#####*Semantic Overview*

*This development is part of "person on duty" project. My aim is to construct search engine mechanism. When you type something to "textbox" on google. It will bring related result. When you type second letter it will bring filtered result. Google probably use bouncing or throttling to bring result from database. My design is just calculating time difference between two events to delay next AJAX request and give sometime to user for typing another input..*
