#####*Semantic Overview*

*This development is part of "person on duty" project. My aim is to construct search engine mechanism.
When you type "textbox" on google. It will bring related result. When you type second letter it will bring filtered result.
Google probabl usey bouncing or throttling for doing that. I calculated time difference in two events for bringing related 
result/results as table.*
